<br>I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at UMass Amherst with specialization in Data Science. My research interests are in Data Mining, applied machine learning, particularly deep learning methods for NLP. <br><br>

I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on designing payment mechanism in Knapsack Auctions, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/sajith/" target="_blank">Prof. G. Sajith.</a><br><br>
